# Between Sessions — Revenue Architecture

## Principle
Revenue must scale with **regulatory dependence**, not feature count.

---

## 1. Base Platform (Per‑Clinic)
**Scope**
- Core adherence workflows
- AER generation (JSON)
- Supervisor weekly packet
- Escalations + SLA tracking

**Value**
- Operational adherence visibility
- Core evidence artifact generation

---

## 2. Compliance Tier (Premium)
**Scope**
- External auditor access
- Deterministic PDFs
- Extended retention
- Audit logs & verification metadata

**Value**
- Payer readiness
- Reduced recoupment risk

---

## 3. Intelligence Tier (Premium)
**Scope**
- LLM‑1 evidence drafting
- LLM‑2 assessment structuring
- Retrieval grounding (approved sources only)

**Value**
- Workflow acceleration
- Documentation consistency
- Still draft‑only

---

## 4. Enterprise / Payer‑Adjacent Tier
**Scope**
- Multi‑clinic rollups
- Compliance trend analytics
- Dedicated audit endpoints
- Contractual SLAs

**Value**
- Portfolio‑level compliance visibility
- Standardized evidence at scale

---

## Pricing Logic (Relative Bands)
- **Base** < **Compliance** < **Intelligence** < **Enterprise**
- Pricing anchored to **compliance dependence**, not seats.

---

## Expansion Path
Clinic → Multi‑clinic → Payer‑adjacent enterprise.

---

## Why AER Access Justifies Pricing
- AER becomes a **regulatory artifact**.
- Compliance becomes **operationally embedded**.
- Switching costs rise with audit dependency.

---

## Intelligence Is an Accelerator, Not the Product
- AI improves speed and consistency.
- Evidence + auditability are the core product.
- Without AER, AI outputs are non‑defensible.

---

## Why Churn Decreases with Regulatory Reliance
- Once AER is embedded in payer workflows, removal increases risk.
- Compliance artifacts create long‑term operational dependency.

---

## Why Competitors Cannot Easily Undercut
- Deterministic audit artifacts and audit logs are not commodity.
- Payer acceptance depends on consistent, defensible structure.
- Regulatory dependence favors depth over features.
