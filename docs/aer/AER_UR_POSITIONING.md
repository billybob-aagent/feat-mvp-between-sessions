# How AER Reduces Utilization Review Risk

## 1. The UR Problem (Plain Language)
- Documentation is inconsistent across clinicians.
- Narratives drift over time.
- Evidence is often reconstructed after the fact.
- Missing data creates denial risk and audit exposure.

---

## 2. How AER Changes the Equation
- Evidence is captured **contemporaneously**.
- Deterministic structure eliminates interpretive drift.
- Escalation and review trails prove oversight.

---

## 3. Common Denial Scenarios → AER Responses

| Denial Scenario | AER Evidence Signals |
|---|---|
| Insufficient evidence of engagement | `adherence_timeline`, `prescribed_interventions.status_summary`, completion events |
| Services not medically necessary | assigned interventions, completion criteria, clinician review state |
| Incomplete documentation | `not_available`, audit metadata, immutable timestamps |

---

## 4. Audit & Recoupment Defense
- Deterministic artifacts reduce reconstruction disputes.
- Supervisor escalation and SLA metadata demonstrate oversight and timeliness.
- Audit logs prove who assigned, who responded, and when.

---

## 5. AI Disclosure (Important)
AER‑related AI is:
- **Policy‑gated**
- **Redacted (PHI‑safe)**
- **Draft‑only**
- **Logged**
- **Clinician‑reviewed**

AI does **not** make decisions, diagnoses, or recommendations.

---

## 6. What AER Does Not Do
- No automated utilization decisions
- No clinical recommendations
- No payer scoring
