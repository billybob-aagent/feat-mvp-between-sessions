## 1) Initial Pilot Outreach
**Subject:** AER pilot -- UR evidence standard validation

Hello <Name>,

We are running a 30-day pilot to validate the Adherence Evidence Report (AER) as a standardized UR artifact. The pilot focuses on evidence quality, auditability, and denial risk reduction.

Proposed scope:
- 3-5 de-identified cases
- AER JSON + deterministic PDF
- 1-2 structured UR review sessions

If you are open to participating, please share availability for a 30-minute kickoff.

Regards,
