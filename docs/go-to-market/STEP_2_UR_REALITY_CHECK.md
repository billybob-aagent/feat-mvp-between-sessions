# STEP 2 -- Payer & UR Reality Check

## Objective
Validate that AER reduces UR friction and denial risk using real reviewer feedback before expanding product scope.

## Inputs
- AER Standard Overview
- Conformance Checklist
- UR Reviewer Packet
- Reality Check Script and Feedback Form

## Execution Steps
1. Select 3-5 payer or UR stakeholders (nurse reviewers, medical directors).
2. Provide the UR Reviewer Packet in advance.
3. Conduct a structured interview using the script.
4. Capture scores and free-text feedback.
5. Aggregate findings and track resolution actions.

## Success Criteria
- Reviewers can map AER evidence to common denial scenarios.
- Feedback identifies clear acceptance blockers (if any).
- AER artifacts are understood without re-explanation.

## Deliverables
- Completed UR Feedback Forms
- Risk log of acceptance blockers
- Updated standard clarifications (if needed)
