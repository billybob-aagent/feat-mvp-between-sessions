# AER UR Reviewer Packet

## Purpose
Provide a concise, structured artifact that shows how AER aligns with UR requirements and common denial scenarios.

## What AER Proves
- Evidence of between-session engagement
- Assignment completion vs non-completion
- Timeliness and escalation oversight

## Denial Mapping Table

| Common UR Denial | AER Evidence Fields |
|---|---|
| Insufficient evidence of engagement | `adherence_timeline`, `prescribed_interventions.status_summary`, `adherence events` |
| Services not medically necessary | assigned interventions, completion criteria, clinician review state |
| Incomplete documentation | `not_available`, audit metadata, immutable timestamps |

## Evidence Guarantees
- Deterministic output
- Date-only period stability
- Traceable actor/time attribution
