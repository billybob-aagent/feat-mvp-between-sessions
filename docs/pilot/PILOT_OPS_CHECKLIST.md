# Pilot ops checklist (Week 1)

Use this checklist to keep a pilot on track without sharing PHI.

## Week 1 steps

1. Confirm staff and client invites are accepted.
2. Assign the first published library item.
3. Ensure the client submits at least one response.
4. Therapist reviews in the review queue.
5. Generate the AER for the first client.
6. Optional: issue an external access token for audit/UR.
7. Optional: generate and apply an AI draft (if enabled).

## Success criteria

- ≥ target reviews per therapist/week.
- Median time-to-review trending down.
- AER generated for ≥ target clients.
- External token used if payer/audit workflow requires it.

## Common blockers

- No published library items available.
- Clinic timezone unset or incorrect.
- Therapists not assigned to clients.
- Review backlog without daily cadence.
