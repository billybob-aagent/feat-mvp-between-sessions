# Migration Notes

This migration includes a drop/re-add of the `clinic_therapist_invites` foreign key and a
`ALTER COLUMN id DROP DEFAULT` for that table. This was auto-generated by Prisma during
`migrate dev` and appears to be schema drift between the DB and Prisma's expected DDL.

Why it is likely harmless:
- The app uses Prisma Client to insert `clinic_therapist_invites` records, and Prisma
  supplies UUIDs client-side for `@default(uuid())`, so the DB default is not relied on.
- The FK is re-added with the same references, so no data shape changes occur.

If you rely on direct SQL inserts into `clinic_therapist_invites` without specifying `id`,
consider restoring a DB default for `id` in a future migration.
