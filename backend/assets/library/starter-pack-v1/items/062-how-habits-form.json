Changing the routine while keeping the cue and reward is often the easiest path.\n\n### Why it matters\n- Habit maps make change more predictable.\n- Small swaps are easier to sustain.\n\n### Try this\n- Identify one cue that starts a habit.\n- Replace the routine with a smaller, healthier step.\n\n### Common traps\n- Trying to change too many habits at once.\n- Ignoring the reward that keeps the habit going."
